				<title>How -f[un]signed-char can break your code</title>
				<description>&lt;p&gt;Most programmers are used to targeting x86 systems where &lt;code&gt;char&lt;/code&gt; is &lt;code&gt;signed char&lt;/code&gt;
by default.  It can lead to this assumption being baked into the code.  Later,
the code might break on a system where defaults differ, causing trouble.  The
first solution you might try to reach out for is &lt;code&gt;-fsigned-char&lt;/code&gt; compiler&amp;#39;s
switch, but there is a catch there which might or might not matter for a
specific code base.&lt;/p&gt;

				<title>Why do new software tools look shiny?</title>
				<description>&lt;p&gt;It puzzles me when people get excited about some new tool which is just a
rewrite of an old one.  Usually it is written in a different language by its
proponents and is more a testament to lack of fantasy rather than an indication
of a need for one more copy of an old program.  What&amp;#39;s more interesting though
is an appeal these new implementations have for users which&amp;mdash;I
claim&amp;mdash;are mostly superficial.  Below is my take on some pros and cons.&lt;/p&gt;

				<title>Inventing grammar for GNU Make</title>
				<description>&lt;p&gt;For the purpose of making &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/xaizek/zograscope&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;zograscope&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; support parsing of more than just
one language, there was a need to pick a language that is substantially
different from C (the first one supported).  &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/xaizek/zograscope&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;GNU Make&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; language
certainly looked like an interesting option right from the start and it&amp;#39;s a tool
that I use regularly.  However, finding a grammar to implement it turned out to
be a problem.  Since grammar wasn&amp;#39;t found, it was created.&lt;/p&gt;

				<title>More than 256 color pairs in curses</title>
				<description>&lt;p&gt;Those who used &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Curses_(programming_library)&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;curses&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; at least once to draw something in color
had to notice that setting colors happens in pairs (foreground and background)
and number of such pairs is limited.
These limitations and some basics about upgrading code to lift one of the limits
will be described in this short post.&lt;/p&gt;

				<title>New tool: pipedial (terminal element picker)</title>
				<description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://code.reversed.top/user/xaizek/pipedial&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;pipedial&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; is one more tool for selecting something in console.
Existence of many such tools might be a valid criticism against creating more,
but not for those who think in terms of
&lt;kbd&gt;h&lt;/kbd&gt;/&lt;kbd&gt;j&lt;/kbd&gt;/&lt;kbd&gt;k&lt;/kbd&gt;/&lt;kbd&gt;l&lt;/kbd&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

				<title>Weboob as an alternative way of browsing WWW</title>
				<description>&lt;p&gt;Turns out there is a nice project that provides another way of accessing some
parts of the Web that doesn&amp;#39;t require using a browser.  It&amp;#39;s called
&lt;a href=&quot;http://weboob.org/&quot;&gt;Weboob&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

				<title>Take off GitHub with RocketGit</title>
				<description>&lt;p&gt;Announcement of GitHub being acquired by Microsoft prompted many people to
consider migrating away from it.  Yet this isn&amp;#39;t really something new as one
could hear similar thoughts expressed even before that (&lt;a href=&quot;https://sanctum.geek.nz/why-not-github.html&quot;&gt;see&lt;/a&gt;)
and I personally chose not to publish a fork of one popular project on GitHub
months before the announcement.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The sad truth is that there aren&amp;#39;t that many real alternatives there and
even if one reaches for self-hosting solutions instead of a third-party service,
they tend to be disappointing in some way.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Recently I have discovered a project which looks like it might be a
solution I was looking for.&lt;/p&gt;

				<title>Propaganda in IT: Microsoft Buys GitHub: The Linux Foundation’s Reaction</title>
				<description>&lt;p&gt;It&amp;#39;s been over a week since MS declared that it buys GitHub, which generated a
lot of discussions, but one of the most interesting pieces is a &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.linuxfoundation.org/blog/microsoft-buys-github-the-linux-foundations-reaction/&quot;&gt;post from The
Linux Foundation&lt;/a&gt;.  It is quite short and at the same time seems to be
constructed to sway people in a certain direction that can serve as a nice
example on propaganda.  Let&amp;#39;s take a look at how things are worded, what is
omitted and how the rest is framed.&lt;/p&gt;

				<title>Come to terms with computer terms</title>
				<description>&lt;p&gt;There are many things which people get wrong over and over again.  People seem
to care enough to repeat these mistakes out loud regularly, but apparently not
enough to actually check correctness of the information or at least question it.
Let&amp;#39;s deal with some claims of this sort from IT field which bug me personally.&lt;/p&gt;

				<title>How to make perf TUI work</title>
				<description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Perf_(Linux)&quot;&gt;perf&lt;/a&gt; is a quite handy tool to quickly measure performance of your
application on GNU/Linux without recompiling it.  The only issue seemed to be
inconvenience of viewing report in a pager.  It turned into concern after
realising that it should start &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Text-based_user_interface&quot;&gt;TUI&lt;/a&gt; on &lt;code&gt;perf report&lt;/code&gt; by default, but
for some reason it didn&amp;#39;t.&lt;/p&gt;

				<title>Updating mail receiving stack</title>
				<description>&lt;p&gt;Calling it a &amp;quot;stack&amp;quot; is probably too much, but &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fetchmail&quot;&gt;fetchmail&lt;/a&gt; and
&lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Procmail&quot;&gt;procmail&lt;/a&gt; seem to go together and they are both subject for
replacement for good reasons.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After finally deciding to replace fetchmail and procmail with something newer,
came realization that there aren&amp;#39;t that many choices out there and still quite
a lot of people continue recommending fetchmail+procmail.  This post is here to
contribute to transferring to potentially more secure software.&lt;/p&gt;

				<title>Conditional ignorance in C++</title>
				<description>&lt;p&gt;It just so happened that I watched several C++ talks that mention upcoming
feature of C++17 called &amp;quot;If statement with initializer&amp;quot; all in a relatively
short time frame.  Unfortunately, there was another common trait among all of
these presentations, which is the topic of this post.&lt;/p&gt;

				<title>The big list of Vi[m]-like software</title>
				<description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;A more interactive version of this post is available at &lt;a href=&quot;https://vim.reversed.top/&quot;&gt;https://vim.reversed.top/&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Last updated: December 1, 2019&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are a number of similar lists already, but they usually lack
grouping and miss pointing out things that are of interest for the author of
this one.  So based on those lists and other sources here&amp;#39;s another one, which
actually might be the biggest so far.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The listing is followed by some critique, which obviously comes from
personal views and experience, so don&amp;#39;t expect to agree with everything in that
section.&lt;/p&gt;

				<title>Skipping standard C++ library during debug session in gdb</title>
				<description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;UPDATE&lt;/strong&gt;: if you have new gdb (7.12.1), scroll to the bottom.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ability to inline functions and methods in C++ is one of the reasons programs in
C++ are so fast.  As such code provided by libraries effectively becomes part of
its client application and the great and mighty &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GNU_Debugger&quot;&gt;gdb&lt;/a&gt; knows what
inline functions are, this might cause inconveniences during debugging.  The
problem is that while stepping into a method one can get into one of many
inlined functions that aren&amp;#39;t interesting.&lt;/p&gt;

				<title>ncurses wrappers for C++</title>
				<description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Curses_(programming_library)&quot;&gt;curses&lt;/a&gt; is a well known set of libraries (with mostly common API)
for creating &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Text-based_user_interface&quot;&gt;TUIs&lt;/a&gt;.  What is significantly less known though is that
&lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ncurses&quot;&gt;ncurses&lt;/a&gt; implementation comes with C++ wrappers for its C API.&lt;/p&gt;

				<title>Converting Vim documentation file to HTML</title>
				<description>&lt;p&gt;Vim has a great documentation for sure.  Part of its greatness is documentation
format itself.  The only difficulty is that it can&amp;#39;t be easily converted to and
from other formats, which might be sometimes desirable or at least useful to
provide same documentation in different form.  In particular, conversion into
HTML is sometimes useful and although there is an HTML version of Vim
documentation, the tool with which it&amp;#39;s produced has never been made public.
There is another way around it without the need to write such a tool from
scratch.&lt;/p&gt;

				<title>C++ manual pages</title>
				<description>&lt;p&gt;One of the great things about C is that its documentation is available locally
via &lt;code&gt;man&lt;/code&gt; command.  That&amp;#39;s very convenient and one might expect to get the same
for C++, but (say) &lt;code&gt;man std::adjacent_difference&lt;/code&gt; will usually just print:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot; data-lang=&quot;text&quot;&gt;No manual entry for std::adjacent_difference
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Luckily, there are ways to fix it.&lt;/p&gt;

				<title>Switching from tmux to GNU Screen</title>
				<description>&lt;p&gt;I was postponing learning how to use &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Terminal_multiplexer&quot;&gt;terminal multiplexers&lt;/a&gt; for a
long time until one day had to test integration with &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tmux&quot;&gt;tmux&lt;/a&gt;, which
required learning it.  So I was using tmux since then and always thinking
whether I could do better by using &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GNU_Screen&quot;&gt;GNU Screen&lt;/a&gt; instead.  After
all, most of &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GNU&quot;&gt;GNU&lt;/a&gt; applications turn out to be quite versatile and
extremely useful, so why GNU Screen wouldn&amp;#39;t have these properties?  This is
especially reasonable question if one recalls that tmux was modeled after GNU
Screen.&lt;/p&gt;

				<title>Enabling output colorization in GCC</title>
				<description>&lt;p&gt;I was waiting for GCC 4.9 for a while to get my hands on colorized color output,
but after it became available in Slackware error output didn&amp;#39;t magically become
colored.  This might not be the case for other distributions, but since it took
me some time to make this work and after more than six month I still can&amp;#39;t find
any related posts on the Internet right away here&amp;#39;s a short note.&lt;/p&gt;

				<title>C++11+ aggregate initializer surprise</title>
				<description>&lt;p&gt;There is a nice thing in C++ called &lt;code&gt;friend&lt;/code&gt;ship between classes or classes and
functions, which is used to put several entities in one security domain by
allowing &amp;quot;friends&amp;quot; to access private fields.  This language feature is usually
criticized as something that breaks encapsulation, which is not actually true as
C++ is multi-paradigm language rather than being just OOP-language and such
exceptions should be viewed as another way of doing things, not as something
&amp;quot;wrong&amp;quot; (which is very subjective, by the way).&lt;/p&gt;

				<title>Range iterator for Boost.PropertyTree items</title>
				<description>&lt;p&gt;The other day I was looking for a way to obtain fully qualified names of items
in &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.boost.org/doc/libs/1_58_0/doc/html/property_tree.html&quot;&gt;Boost.PropertyTree&lt;/a&gt; in sorted order, but basically found only &lt;a href=&quot;http://duck-wrath.blogspot.com/2012/02/how-to-recursive-parse.html&quot;&gt;one post
on the subject&lt;/a&gt;, which demonstrated recursive traversal of a tree in more
detail than iteration over all keys.  What I wanted is an iterator based
solution, which could be employed in C++11 &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/C%2B%2B11#Range-based_for_loop&quot;&gt;range-based for loop&lt;/a&gt;.
So I ended up writing one.&lt;/p&gt;

				<title>Clang by example: Detecting wrong first include</title>

(you are here)
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;Introduction&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There is a well known (or at least I hope that it&amp;#39;s &lt;em&gt;well&lt;/em&gt; known) good practice
to include header that corresponds to the current source file before including
any other headers.  It&amp;#39;s recommended by multiple C++ coding style guides (for
example by &lt;a href=&quot;http://google-styleguide.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/cppguide.xml#Names_and_Order_of_Includes&quot;&gt;Google C++ Style Guide&lt;/a&gt;) and indeed
makes sense to follow.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To put it short: it makes finding incomplete headers really easy.  If you
forget to include required header, corresponding source file just won&amp;#39;t compile.
This way there will be no hidden (implicit) dependencies among modules of a
project as well as dependencies on system headers.  Below is a simple example
that demonstrates such situation.&lt;/p&gt;

				<title>Why restoring signal handlers is important</title>
				<description>&lt;p&gt;I experienced strange failures of some commands in &lt;code&gt;gvim&lt;/code&gt; (e.g. errors on
closing window of &lt;code&gt;:Gblame&lt;/code&gt;) for quite a while, but couldn&amp;#39;t figure out why the
hell their occur.  Overall it probably took more than 20 hours to identify the
issue and solve it not causing any other issues to arise.  At the end of the
day it took single line to solve the issue...&lt;/p&gt;

				<description>&lt;p&gt;I remember &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CIFS&quot;&gt;CIFS/SMB&lt;/a&gt; working fine for me, but it occasionally
mysteriously didn&amp;#39;t work on some machines even with 100% correct configuration
(e.g. line in &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fstab&quot;&gt;/etc/fstab&lt;/a&gt;).  It actually happened not only on
Slackware, but also on Debian, though not sure what was causing issues there.&lt;/p&gt;

				<title>How to install data directory with automake</title>
				<description>&lt;p&gt;I thought that adding directory to &lt;code&gt;pkgdata_DATA&lt;/code&gt; variable in &lt;code&gt;Makefile.am&lt;/code&gt;
file would be enough, but &lt;code&gt;make install&lt;/code&gt; command gave this error:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot; data-lang=&quot;text&quot;&gt;/usr/bin/ginstall: omitting directory ‘../data/vim/’

				<title>How to make bootable win7 installation USB stick in GNU/Linux</title>
				<description>&lt;p&gt;For most bootable ISO images one of two approaches works:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;code&gt;dd if=image.iso of=/dev/sdx&lt;/code&gt; if image is a hybrid CD-ROM/HD image.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Extracting image via &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UNetbootin&quot;&gt;UNetbootin&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, none of this works for Windows setup disks, even if you do this on
Windows.  Usually I go with &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UltraISO&quot;&gt;UltraISO&lt;/a&gt;&amp;#39;s &amp;quot;Write hard drive
image&amp;quot;, which works fine.  But there is no UltraISO for GNU/Linux and one has
to go another road.&lt;/p&gt;

				<title>Fix graphic errors after replacing NVIDIA card with Intel Graphics</title>
				<description>&lt;p&gt;After upgrading motherboard and its components, regular graphics (windows,
video) worked fine with Intel HD Graphics, but trying to run something like
&lt;code&gt;glxgears&lt;/code&gt; displayed nothing but blank window.  It was strange as Intel drivers
are open source and known for their good work in GNU/Linux.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Split_(Unix)&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;split&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/a&gt; command, but how to break file into pieces of variable

				<title>rexima: couldn't open mixer device</title>

do &lt;code&gt;slackpkg install rexima&lt;/code&gt; to install it).  The output was:&lt;/p&gt;

				<title>Removing sendmail from mail receiving chain</title>
				<description>&lt;p&gt;One of common ways to receive mail includes using &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sendmail&quot;&gt;sendmail&lt;/a&gt; as
an &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Message_transfer_agent&quot;&gt;MTA&lt;/a&gt;.  This causes some inconvenience especially when it&amp;#39;s the
only purpose &lt;em&gt;sendmail&lt;/em&gt; is installed for.  To be able to receive mail
&lt;em&gt;sendmail&lt;/em&gt; deamon must be running all the time, which also means that it
consumes some (small) amount of resources.  It&amp;#39;s not a problem at all (even
though it slows down system startup a little bit), but why keep it if we can
live without it?&lt;/p&gt;

				<title>How to make tabs visible in git diff</title>
				<description>&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;m a bit tired looking at diffs like the following:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-diff&quot; data-lang=&quot;diff&quot;&gt;         for (int i = 0; i &amp;lt; 3; ++i) {
&lt;span class=&quot;gd&quot;&gt;-        for (int h = 0; h &amp;lt; 4; ++h) {&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;gi&quot;&gt;+                for (int h = 0; h &amp;lt; 4; ++h) {&lt;/span&gt;
                         for (int k = 0; k &amp;lt; 4; ++k) {
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Can anybody tell whether spaces were replaces with tabs or tabs were replaced
with spaces without knowing anything else about the code?  Probably, not.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4&gt;Foreword&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Llvm&quot;&gt;LLVM&lt;/a&gt; project has been started back in 2000, but became widely
known and used quite recently, about 4 years as of now (2014).  It&amp;#39;s used by
hardware manufactures to implement programming languages for their products as
well as by software engineering companies to develop their own programs.  There
are two main reasons why LLVM gained such popularity:&lt;/p&gt;

				<title>How to recompile source file on each build using make</title>
				<description>&lt;h3&gt;Motivation&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It&amp;#39;s sometimes useful to see precise date and time an application was compiled.
So such information should be embedded into application at compile time and
displayed on user&amp;#39;s request.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;it is very powerful;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;yet quite easy to use from command-line;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;has sane defaults;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;no GUI which just stands between me and video I want to watch.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So far, so good.  The only thing that bothered me for a while is that subtitles
are enabled by default.&lt;/p&gt;

				<title>Out-of-class overload of unary operators in C++</title>
				<description>&lt;p&gt;This may sound strange, but it seems that I have never thought about overloading
of unary operators in C++, which are not implemented as member functions.  It&amp;#39;s
not like it sounds strange or incorrect, I just never wanted to do it.  So, just
to be able to say &amp;quot;I did it at least once&amp;quot;, lets try it out on a very basic
example with overloading of postfix increment operator:&lt;/p&gt;

				<title>How to set `xterm-256color` type of terminal in xterm on Slackware Linux?</title>
				<description>&lt;p&gt;Recently support for processing escape sequences in preview window was added to
vifm.  So I added highlighting of source code in my preview window using
&lt;a href=&quot;https://sourceforge.net/projects/syntaxhighlight&quot;&gt;highlight&lt;/a&gt; tool specifying &lt;code&gt;-O ansi&lt;/code&gt; to make it generate ansi compatible
escape codes.  But some of syntax group obtained the same color, because I had
my terminal configured to display up to 8 colors.  To solve the issue, I decided
to start using &lt;code&gt;xterm-256color&lt;/code&gt; terminal mode in xterm.  Here&amp;#39;s where all fun
began.&lt;/p&gt;

There were some old scripts in python, but they didn&amp;#39;t look very promising to
me.  So after spending some time on search &lt;a href=&quot;http://does-not-exist.org/mail-archives/mutt-users/msg03132.html&quot;&gt;this answer to my question&lt;/a&gt; was
found.&lt;/p&gt;

				<title>How to share code among several Web-service applications written in Java</title>
				<description>&lt;p&gt;Some time ago I&amp;#39;ve spent a lot of time trying to figure out how one can share
common parts of code in two Web-services running in &lt;a href=&quot;http://tomcat.apache.org/&quot;&gt;Apache Tomcat&lt;/a&gt;.  What I
wanted is to move several packages to a separate Eclipse project and refer to it
from several other projects.  Somewhere on the Web a nice list of options to
achieve this was found.  All (or almost all) of them were connected with the
&lt;code&gt;Classpath&lt;/code&gt; settings pane in the project options.  But unfortunately no matter
what &lt;code&gt;Classpath&lt;/code&gt; options I set, it didn&amp;#39;t work.  I&amp;#39;ve also tried exporting
project with the common functionallity to a jar file and linking to it from
other project.  That didn&amp;#39;t work either, that jar file wasn&amp;#39;t deployed to Tomcat
server.&lt;/p&gt;

				<title>Double brace initializers in Java</title>
				<description>&lt;p&gt;Unfortunately, some features of well known programming languages are much less
known than others.  Eventually, those unknown features are quite powerful and
useful.  Today I&amp;#39;m going to describe so called &amp;quot;double brace initialization&amp;quot;
in Java, which is quite similar (and more powerful) than object initializers of
C#.&lt;/p&gt;

				<title>strchr() finds zero character</title>
				<description>&lt;p&gt;As any other programmer once in a while I find some new tiny but quite useful
trick, which I then apply to my sources.  One of such trick is using of
&lt;code&gt;strchr()&lt;/code&gt; function to compare if a value of type &lt;code&gt;char&lt;/code&gt; equals to one of
values.&lt;/p&gt;

				<title>Making ~/.inputrc work in slackware</title>
				<description>&lt;p&gt;Today I accidentally trapped on &lt;a href=&quot;https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/Bash#Faster_completion&quot;&gt;this part&lt;/a&gt; of Arch Linux wiki page on Bash.
And decided to try putting &lt;code&gt;set show-all-if-ambiguous On&lt;/code&gt; to my ~/.inputrc,
which was created for this.&lt;/p&gt;

				<title>Configuring keys in less</title>
				<description>&lt;p&gt;Since I&amp;#39;m using Vim and terminal constantly the only right way of going through
command-line history in my world is using &lt;code&gt;Control-P&lt;/code&gt; (&lt;code&gt;&amp;lt;c-p&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt; or &lt;code&gt;^P&lt;/code&gt;; to go
backwards) and &lt;code&gt;Control-N&lt;/code&gt; (&lt;code&gt;&amp;lt;c-n&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt; or &lt;code&gt;^N&lt;/code&gt; to go forwards).&lt;/p&gt;

				<title>How to connect a computer behind NAT to another computer behind NAT using ssh</title>
				<description>&lt;p&gt;I was wondering how can I connect to my laptop from work for some time, but
didn&amp;#39;t know how to do that without using VPN.  I even decided that it&amp;#39;s
impossible to do something simple, but then... I realized that a third party
server to which I have access through ssh can be used for this.&lt;/p&gt;

				<title>An issue with colour prompt in bash</title>
				<description>&lt;h3&gt;Prehistory&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Once I read somewhere that it&amp;#39;s possible to add some colours to your shell&amp;#39;s
(bash in my case) prompt using escape sequences.  I thought that it will
greatly decrease time one spend finding the beginning of a command that was just
run.  Prompt colouring is also useful to distinguish between root and regular
user prompt.  So after some experiments with &lt;code&gt;echo&lt;/code&gt; command, I added this line
to my &lt;code&gt;~/.bashrc&lt;/code&gt; file:&lt;/p&gt;

				<title>Browsing directories using Vim's wildmenu</title>
				<description>&lt;p&gt;Today I accidentally found a very unexpected thing in Vim.  While trying to
make wildmenu disappear I hit some of arrow keys and great truth was uncovered
to me:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot; data-lang=&quot;text&quot;&gt;one can browse file system in wildmenu using arrow keys!
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

				<title>gem install issue</title>
				<description>&lt;p&gt;This day I finally made a decision to start posting some notes on computer
related stuff and mainly about how I solved some minor issues with software.
Several month ago I already picked statically generated sites and GitHub pages
as a hosting (I don&amp;#39;t expect other people to read this, I just don&amp;#39;t want to
forget anything of it :-), so such hosting is enough for my needs).  So I found
a post &lt;a href=&quot;http://davidwinter.me/articles/2011/10/29/setting-up-github-pages/&quot;&gt;Setting up Github Pages&lt;/a&gt; written by David Winter and started
following steps described there.&lt;/p&gt;
