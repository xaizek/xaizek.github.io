<p>I was postponing learning how to use <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Terminal_multiplexer">terminal multiplexers</a> for a
long time until one day had to test integration with <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tmux">tmux</a>, which
required learning it.  So I was using tmux since then and always thinking
whether I could do better by using <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GNU_Screen">GNU Screen</a> instead.  After
all, most of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GNU">GNU</a> applications turn out to be quite versatile and
extremely useful, so why GNU Screen wouldn&#39;t have these properties?  This is
especially reasonable question if one recalls that tmux was modeled after GNU
Screen.</p>

<!-- cut -->

<p>There is enough basic tutorials and configuration dumps of <code>.screenrc</code> out there
on the Internet, so I won&#39;t create one more.  Instead, I&#39;ll explain what wasn&#39;t
immediately clear to me, mention wrong facts about GNU Screen (some of which are
not really &quot;wrong&quot;, they just outdated by now) and provide <code>.screenrc</code> with
comments (well, yeah, there is a configuration dump at the end).</p>

<h3>Terminology difficulties</h3>

<p>Let&#39;s take Vim&#39;s terminology as a good example and then proceed to tmux and GNU
Screen.  Vim has the following entities when it comes to files and how they
appear on the screen:</p>

<ul>
<li>buffer -- holds the file</li>
<li>window -- displays one of buffers</li>
<li>tab -- displays one or more windows</li>
</ul>

<p>tmux provides nice example of how one should <em>never</em> name things (it still gives
me hard time remembering the naming):</p>

<ul>
<li>window -- this is a &quot;tab&quot; in Vim and pretty much any other application</li>
<li>pane -- this is a &quot;window&quot; in Vim (very intuitive to name different things with
      very similar words, isn&#39;t it?..)</li>
</ul>

<p>Naming is not strong part of GNU Screen as well, but there is a logic behind
most of it:</p>

<ul>
<li>window -- this is like a &quot;buffer&quot; in Vim (strange naming, but it gets better)</li>
<li>region -- this is like a &quot;window&quot; in Vim (makes sense, &quot;region&quot; suits well)</li>
<li>layout -- a &quot;tab&quot; in Vim (near perfect match, &quot;tab&quot; is just a layout
        container)</li>
</ul>

<p>At least both applications could agree on calling sessions &quot;sessions&quot;...</p>

<h3>Layout</h3>

<p>Continuing to use Vim as a base for comparison.  This time tmux generally
behaves closer to what I would expect, but GNU Screen is getting there if one
uses buffer commands in Vim.</p>

<p>Creating new &quot;window&quot; in tmux creates a tab where you can place multiple
&quot;panes&quot;, closing an application running in a &quot;pane&quot; removes that part of the
screen.  It&#39;s like combination of <code>:tabnew</code> and <code>:q</code> in Vim.</p>

<p>GNU Screen puts regions above their content and one can easily loop through all
applications in each of the regions.  If application is closed, GNU Screen puts
next available &quot;window&quot; where just closed application used to be.  Something
similar happens on <code>:bdelete</code> in Vim.  There is even a thing called &quot;empty
region&quot;, which is like empty buffer in Vim you get after typing <code>:bdelete</code> too
many times.  It&#39;s this &quot;empty region&quot; you see by default right after a split.</p>

<h4>Splits</h4>

<p>Many people still think that GNU Screen doesn&#39;t provide vertical splits, which
is not true since Version 4.2.0 (17/04/2014), which added <code>-v</code> option to <code>split</code>
command.</p>

<h4>Tabs</h4>

<p>Other people (or the same) might not know that one can have multiple independent
layouts at the same time without running GNU Screen in GNU Screen (yes, people
did this and had to type prefix key multiple times).  Also available since 4.2.0
version.</p>

<h4>Result of differences</h4>

<p>In tmux I usually ended up having too many open &quot;windows&quot; (which are tabs, in
case you got lost), GNU Screen seems to improve my workflow by limiting
amount of different layouts only to those I actually need, which should be a
good thing and should teach me to be more careful regarding closing application
and corresponding region.  Although, this might be very specific to my workflow,
as I tend to overuse tabs even if I don&#39;t really need them.</p>

<h3>Command syntax</h3>

<p>I heard that GNU Screen had horrible configuration syntax, but I don&#39;t see it
being much different from the one tmux has.  Honestly, I still don&#39;t know why
there are <code>set-option</code>, <code>set-window-option</code>, <code>set-option -g</code> and
<code>set-window-option -g</code> in tmux and when one should use one or another.  So I
find configuration in GNU Screen more straightforward and obvious, although it
differs from <code>:set</code> in Vim, but this allows additional options and extended
syntax, which is handy.</p>

<h4>Command grouping</h4>

<p>One notable difference is how one can run multiple commands.  In tmux commands
can be separated by <code>\;</code> (two characters), GNU Screen requires using <code>eval</code>
command which interprets each argument as a separate command (it seems to have
some differences compared to normal shell expansion, note that).</p>

<h3>Other</h3>

<h4>Status line</h4>

<p>Global one is called &quot;hardstatus&quot; and there is also a &quot;caption&quot; (per region).
Looks like it can&#39;t be put at the top of the window, unlike tmux.  On the other
hand, it&#39;s not an issue here as editing command-line happens above the &quot;caption&quot;
and it&#39;s not as confusing as in tmux (although highlight is a bit strange at
least with my setup).  Another good thing about it is that completion matches
are displayed similar to Vim with &#39;wildmenu&#39; option turned on.</p>

<p><strong>(UPD 2016-06-29)</strong>  Found out that version 4.3.0 added <code>firstline</code> value to
<code>hardstatus</code> command.  So having status line at the top is possible!  (Not sure
which version I had installed before.)  Command-line editing in this case still
happens at the bottom, but unfortunately completion doesn&#39;t show up then (not
a tragedy actually as it turned out, one doesn&#39;t configure terminal multiplexer
in live mode usually)..</p>

<p>Not sure how to display list of layouts on status line, don&#39;t see escape codes
for this.</p>

<h4>Colors</h4>

<p>Don&#39;t see a way to specify colors from 256 palette, only standard 16.  tmux has
<code>colourXXX</code> for this.</p>

<h4>Boundaries</h4>

<p>Not able to set custom characters for boundaries or different boundary for
current region.</p>

<h4>Text copying</h4>

<p>Can&#39;t pipe copy buffer to a command in GNU Screen, but one can write it to a
file and then do something with it.</p>

<p>Also can&#39;t find history of copied text (<kbd>prefix+=</kbd> by default in tmux),
but there are registers.</p>

<p>On searches with <kbd>/</kbd> or <kbd>?</kbd> previous search is automatically
cleared for you, which is great, never understood why it&#39;s not the case in tmux
(it&#39;s probably one of a few applications with such strange implementation).</p>

<h4>Directory of a split</h4>

<p>Don&#39;t see a nice way of using working directory of current process in newly
created split.</p>

<h4>Command classes</h4>

<p>I&#39;m not aware of similar feature in tmux, but GNU Screen allows creation of new
modes, although they are named &quot;classes&quot; here.</p>

<p>There are two parts for this.  First, commands are defined in some command
class:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-text" data-lang="text">bind -c &lt;class&gt; &lt;key&gt; &lt;command&gt;
</code></pre></div>
<p>Second, some key is used to enter this class:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-text" data-lang="text">bind &lt;key&gt; command -c &lt;class&gt;
</code></pre></div>
<p>An example of resize mode is provided below.</p>

<p>Note that each command leaves the mode, so to stay in it one needs to &quot;re-enter&quot;
it again:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-text" data-lang="text">bind -c &lt;class&gt; &lt;key&gt; eval &quot;&lt;command&gt;&quot; &quot;command -c &lt;class&gt;&quot;
</code></pre></div>
<p>Actually, it is not exactly a mode, but a way to define custom prefix characters
and put some key bindings in separates namespaces.  Yet, it&#39;s powerful enough to
emulate modes on some level.</p>

<h3>Configuration</h3>

<p>Precaution for colors you see below: mine are changed for <code>xterm</code> via
<code>~/.xresources</code>.</p>

<p>Not sure if it&#39;s the same on all systems, but at least on Slackware there are a
bunch of settings in sample <code>.screenrc</code> that correct termcapinfo and alike,
won&#39;t repeat them here (they present in <a href="https://github.com/xaizek/dotfiles/blob/master/screenrc">actual configuration file</a>).</p>

<h4>General configuration</h4>
<div class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-bash" data-lang="bash"><span class="c"># don&#39;t display lengthy license and version information on startup</span>

</code></pre></div>
<h4>Interface</h4>
<div class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-bash" data-lang="bash"><span class="c"># set color of borders and command-line (cyan background, black foreground)</span>
rendition <span class="nv">so</span> <span class="o">=</span> ck
</code></pre></div>
<h5>Titles</h5>
<div class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-bash" data-lang="bash"><span class="c"># status line with current window highlighted</span>
hardstatus alwayslastline <span class="s1">&#39;%{Rk}%?%{dd}%E ESC %{Rk}%:     %?%=%?%{gk} %-Lw%?%{kW} %n*%f%t%?(%u)%? %{= gk}%?%+Lw %{Rk}%:%{Rk} %?%=&#39;</span>
</code></pre></div>
<p>This requires additional configuration for bash:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-bash" data-lang="bash"><span class="c"># set screen title</span>
<span class="k">if</span> <span class="o">[</span> -z <span class="s2">&quot;$TMUX&quot;</span> <span class="o">]</span><span class="p">;</span> <span class="k">then</span>
    <span class="c"># when in shell, to current path</span>
    <span class="k">case</span> <span class="nv">$TERM</span> in
        screen*<span class="o">)</span>
            <span class="nv">PS1</span><span class="o">=</span><span class="s1">&#39;\[\033k\w\033\\\]&#39;</span><span class="nv">$PS1</span>
            <span class="p">;;</span>
        *<span class="o">)</span> <span class="p">;;</span>
    <span class="k">esac</span>
    <span class="c"># otherwise to command name</span>
    <span class="nv">PROMPT_COMMAND</span><span class="o">=</span><span class="s2">&quot;echo -ne &#39;\033k\033\0134&#39;;$PROMPT_COMMAND&quot;</span>
<span class="k">fi</span>
</code></pre></div>
<p>This way title is:</p>

<ul>
<li>set to current directory (<code>\w</code> in <code>$PS1</code> above) if we&#39;re in a shell</li>
<li>set to command name (e.g. <code>vim</code>) after we run a command from shell</li>
</ul>

<p>Hardline looks like this:</p>

<p><img src="/images/screen-hardline.png" alt="hardline of screen"></p>

<p>From left to right:</p>

<ul>
<li><code>ESC</code> -- signals about pressed prefix key (disappears afterwards)</li>
<li>light red -- regular background</li>
<li>light green -- background of inactive window</li>
<li>black background -- active window</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>(UPD 2016-06-29)</strong>  Version 4.3.0 added <code>x</code> and <code>X</code> specifiers that provide
name of current command (with/without arguments), which can simplify the setup
above if you&#39;re ready to drop displaying of current directory in a shell.</p>

<h4>Bindings</h4>

<h3>Conclusion</h3>

<p>Again it started as testing of integration, but I&#39;m using GNU Screen more than a
week now and probably will stick with it.  There are some things worth
improving (I get strange 10 second delay before closing a shell which spawned at
least one graphical application and got used to opening new split in working
directory of current process), but general impression is good.  The upshot is:
try it yourself rather than reading posts about how superior tmux is, the latter
is really not that different from GNU Screen.</p>
